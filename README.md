# Dinner Picker ü•ê

## Description

This app allows the user to create a digital recipe book that helps create a randomized menu based on the recipes that are stored by the user. It helps solve the timeless adage of, ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs for dinner?‚Äù. Users will have to create a log in by signing up with email address and password. In addition, the user will have the customized menu with their log ins. The user will be able to add specific recipe and add, add as favorite, update/change, and delete the recipe. That being said, to pick a dinner will be more fun and enjoyable time by creating your own "Menu".
